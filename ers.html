      <h2>What is the Elo Rating System?</h2>
      <p>
        The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess. Developed by Arpad Elo, it is widely used by chess federations around the world.

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player has a rating, typically starting around 1200.</li>
        <li>When two players compete, the expected outcome is calculated based on their ratings.</li>
        <li>After the game, ratings are adjusted depending on the result and the expected score.</li>
        <li>Winning against a stronger opponent gains more points; losing to a weaker one loses more.</li>
      </ul>
