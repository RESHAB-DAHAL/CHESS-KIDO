            <h2>PAWN</h2>
            <p>The pawn is the smallest and most numerous piece on the chessboard, with each player starting the game with eight.<br>
            Though it may seem modest, the pawn plays a vital role in shaping strategy and controlling space.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
            <img src="move-pawn.jpeg" alt="move pawn" width="100px" height="100px"><br>
            <strong>Movement:</strong> Pawns move forward one square at a time. On their first move, they have the option to advance two squares.<br>
            <img src="capture-pawn.png" width="100px" height="100px"><br>
            <strong>Capturing:</strong> Pawns capture diagonally—one square forward to the left or right.<br>
            <img src="pawn-promote.png" alt="pawn Promotion" width="100px" height="100px"><br>
            <strong>Promotion:</strong> Reaching the opposite end allows promotion to any piece (except king), usually a queen.<br>

            <strong>En Passant:</strong> A special rule to capture a pawn that moved two squares forward from its starting position.

            <h3>Strategic Importance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Pawns help control key squares and restrict enemy movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Pawn formations define the character of the position.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacrifice & Initiative:</strong> Used in gambits to gain tempo or open lines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite their limited mobility, pawns can become powerful assets when used wisely. Their journey from foot soldier to queen symbolizes growth, patience, and tactical foresight.</p>
